The server initializes the server socket and waits for 2 clients to connect.
As soon as two clients connect start_game() gets executed and sends a signal to both client to signal the beginning of the game.
In the main game loop, each player is either waiting of playing. In each turn, the server sends the current board and one status flag (a total of 10 4-byte integers) to each player.
If a player has to send a move, the client first checks if his input is allowed. If it is, it sends it back to the server. After each turn, the server checks if there's a winner, if not, the game continues until there's a tie.
